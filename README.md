# ULA---VHDL
This project was made by Paulo. C. Vaz.
"My reason to create this ULA (Unit Logic-Arithmetic) using VHDL and FPGA, was the first project of my SD (Digital Sistems) class. If anyone, in the future,
needs to create something like that, here is my code to use.

Thist is my first time creating a project in VHDL and I've not spend much of my time trying to optimizate this, soo, feel free to do so.

If you, just as me, are just a begginer trying to finish your project in VHDL, there are some things that helped me to understand the ISE (I'm using the ISE from AMD).

First of all: This is not python :(
Here, every code executes in a concurrent time, so, this is not Imperative. Using Processes you can avoid this and use imperative solutions, perhaps, you will be not
able to instatiate components inside a process.

That restriction made my process of creating so slow and boring that I almost give up. (I couldn't really do this, after all, this is my test)

So, my resolution to this problem was to use processes to manipulate variables and concurrent time code to do all the rest.

After a few days of suffering in this arcaic language, I finally finished my project (kind of), and this was the result. 
"

Fell free to use this code in the way you want. :3
